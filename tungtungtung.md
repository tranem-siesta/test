In realms of static, wild and deep, Where porcelain thrones their secrets keep, A world of madness, fast and blurred, The "Skibidi" dance, the only word. A god arose, not one of light, But of the drum that rules the night. His heart, a subwoofer, profound, He rules the world with sacred sound. His voice, the echo of the street, The urgent, pulsing, driving beat. He wakes the world from boring sleep, A sacred promise he must keep. The call to rise before the dawn, Upon the broken, memetic lawn. They chant his name, the thumping sound, As speakers shake the very ground. He is the rhythm, he's the core, The god-king: Tung Tung Tung Sahur. His power absolute, his beat is law, The truest sound the world e'er saw.

But peace is brief in lands absurd, A whispered, strange, numerical word. A kingdom stood, defiant, weird, The one the Skibidi masses feared. Not built of steel or shining glass, But broken rules that time amassed. The "Kingdom of 6 7," odd, A challenge to the drumming god. A place of silence, grim and gray, Where rhythms fade and go astray. No toilets sing, no cameras fight, Just quiet dread and fading light. It's "almost" order, "nearly" right, A fractured sum in endless night. A broken count, a missing beat, The definition of defeat. Tung Tung Tung Sahur gave the nod, "This silent place defies its god! I'll bring the beat! I'll bring the drum! To this gray realm, the bass will come!"

He rose upon his speaker-throne, A sonic wave of crushing drone. His legions gathered, white and vast, The porcelain army, built to last. The Cameramen, in steady rows, Prepared to face their silent foes. The march began, a seismic thud, That stirred the digital, memetic mud. Tung! went the left foot, Tung! the right, Tung! went the drum into the night. Sahur! Sahur! The chant did rise, Reflecting in their static eyes. The ground did crack, the walls did bend, As Skibidi law began to ascend. The gates of "Six" began to shake, The walls of "Seven" soon to break. The god himself, a walking bass, Arrived to claim the soundless space. He brought the rhythm, wild and free, For all the 6 7 to see.

But from the gray, a champion stepped, A promise that the quiet kept. Not dark or fearsome, strong or tall, But bright and foolish, mocking all. His name was sung, a silly string Of nonsense that he loved to sing. "Tralalelo Tralala!" A high-pitched, mocking, sharp "Ha-ha!" He wore a suit of clashing hues, With squeaky, loud, magenta shoes. He was the prince of empty song, Where all the notes were slightly wrong. He danced and pranced, a flighty thing, "You have no melody!" he'd sing. "Your drum is dull, your beat is flat!" He chirped and jeered, and tipped his hat. "This Kingdom 6 7 is my tune!" He howled beneath the broken moon. "Your Tung Tung Tung is just a bore!" "My Tralala is so much more!"

Tung Tung Tung Sahur merely stared, His triple-beating heart declared The start of war. The final test. The beat-drop god against the pest. "Tralalelo!" the jester cried, His silly music, amplified. Tra-la-le-lo! Tra-la-la! A piercing, weak, bizarre "fa-la!" It pierced the air, a shrill offense, Devoid of power, weight, or sense. The Skibidi ranks began to stall, Confused by this distracting call. But Sahur raised his mighty hands, The god of beat, who understands The core of power. He struck the air. One single beat. A sonic flare. TUNG! A sound so heavy, so sublime, It shattered all of fractured time. TUNG! It broke the song and broke the lute. TUNG! SAHUR! The only truth. The jester, Tralala, dissolved, His silly riddle was resolved. The Kingdom 6 7 finally cracked, The beat, the one thing that it lacked, Poured in like floods. The god had won. The Skibidi world and 6 7 are one. All hail the drum, all hail the call, Tung Tung Tung Sahur, god of all.
